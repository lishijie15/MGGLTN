## MGGLTN: Meta Guided-Graph Light-weight TimesNet for Traffic Prediction

### Introduction of Our Model

* We propose a novel high-performance light-weight traffic flow prediction model, aiming to enhance prediction accuracy by effectively decoupling the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of traffic flow. 
* We construct the GCNTimes module that captures the intricate spatio-temporal features of traffic flow in a high-dimensional manner. We explore feature correlations within and across different time periods through frequency domain analysis, and then utilize a meta guided graph to memorize and query spatial features at vary time steps. 
* We integrate light-weight depthwise separable convolutions into the GCNTimes module, to optimize computational efficiency while adapting diverse traffic flow prediction tasks.



### Experiments Results

 Our model achieves or approaches SOTA in major cases and the specific experimental results are shown in the following table.

| Datasets | MAE/RMSE/MAPE@1st step | MAE/RMSE/MAPE@3rd step | MAE/RMSE/MAPE@6th step |
| :------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- |
| METR-LA  | 2.61/5.03/6.44%                 | 3.01/6.09/7.93%        | 3.49/7.3/9.60%         |
| PEMS-BAY | 1.29/2.60/2.65%                 | 1.60/3.69/3.55%        | 1.90/4.46/4.50%        |
| EXPY-TKY | 5.84/9.24/24.77%                 | 6.44/10.35/29.10%      | 6.80/10.97/31.19%      |



### Installation and Run

#### Arguments

- **METR-LA and PEMS-BAY**

  The default hyper-parameters used in our paper are written in MGGLTN_traffic/MGGLTN_main_LABAY.py as follows.
  The ratio for train:valid:test is roughly 7:1:2, generated by generate_training_data.py. 

- **EXPY-TKY:**

  The hyper-parameters for EXPY-TKY are in MGGLTN_traffic/MGGLTN_main.py. Note EXPY-TKY data is structured by month, where '202110' and '202111' used as training and validation and '202112' used as testing. By further setting val_ratio as 0.25 (that meas 25% data of '202110' and '202111' as valid data), the ratio for train:valid:test is roughly 3:1:2. The time interval for EXPY-TKY is 10 minutes. </br>
